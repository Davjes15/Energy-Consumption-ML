The idea of this project is to create a ML model that predicts the consumption of energy in kWh based on the "Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)"
The mircodata set is a sample survey that collects energy-related data for housing units used as primary residence. The data contains 12,083 rows (households) and 938 variables (columns). "The sample represents 113.6 million U.S. households, the Census Bureauâ€™s statistical estimate for all occupied housing units in 2009 derived from their American Community Survey (ACS)." 

The dataset can be found at https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.php?view=microdata

# Energy-Consumption-ML
The jupyter notebook presents the first modeling stage to find relevant variables that will producte a ML model with an acceptable overall performace.
The jupyter notebooks includes:
A. Exploratory Analysis
B. Multicolinearity Analysis
C. Data Cleaning 
D. Feature Selection
E. ML Modeling
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Fully Connected Neural Network
F. Analysis of results


Further steps suggest to explore different features and analyze correlation of variables with target variable to evaluate if the selected variables contribute to produce an ML model.
